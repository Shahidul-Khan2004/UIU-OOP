    // This is the "default constructor" (no input values given).

    // The given values are stored in the objectâ€™s attributes.

    // It makes a new Shape by copying another Shape's values.
    // For example: if shape1 has (length=5, width=6, height=7),
    // and we do Shape shape2 = new Shape(shape1),
    // then shape2 will also have (5, 6, 7).
    Shape (Shape shape) {
        this.height = shape.height;  // Copy the height from the given Shape
        this.width = shape.width;    // Copy the width from the given Shape
        this.length = shape.length;  // Copy the length from the given Shape
